# iOS Navigation Animation Exploration

This project demonstrates different approaches to implementing navigation animations in SwiftUI, inspired by Apple Music's fluid transitions. It explores three distinct implementation methods, each showcasing different capabilities and techniques.

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Traditional Navigation
The basic SwiftUI navigation implementation using `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink`. This serves as a baseline to compare with more advanced techniques.

Key features:
- Standard push-and-pop transitions
- Uses `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink`
- Default animation behaviors

### 2. Navigation Transition (iOS 18+)
Utilizes the new `.navigationTransition` API introduced in iOS 18, offering enhanced transition animations.

Key features:
- Zoom transition effect
- Source-to-destination matching using unique IDs
- Namespace-based coordination

### 3. Matched Geometry Effect
A custom implementation using SwiftUI's `matchedGeometryEffect` for smooth, synchronized animations between views.

Key features:
- Fluid transitions between grid and detail views
- Spring-based animations
- State-driven view transitions

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main view implementations:
- `TraditionalNavigationDemo`: Basic navigation implementation
- `NavigationTransitionDemo`: iOS 18's new transition API
- `MatchedGeometryDemo`: Custom matched geometry animations

Each implementation shares common components:
- `SidebarView`: Navigation sidebar
- `LibraryGridView`: Grid layout for album display
- `AlbumCard`: Individual album item view
- `DetailCard`: Expanded album view

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+ (Basic features)
- iOS 18.0+ (For `.navigationTransition` features)
- Xcode 15.0+
- SwiftUI
